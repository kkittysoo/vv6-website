          <h3>COMMISSIONS</h3>
          <p>
            A commission is a monetary payment made to a salesman for each 	
            transaction made. If a salesperson is paid on commission, 
            the amount they are paid is determined by the amount of product they sell. 
            Taking commissions simply means that an artist is available for work and 
            may provide their services in exchange for a fee.
