          <p>PURPOSE</p>
          <p>This website was created to gain awareness of how we might increase our access		 
            to business knowledge through this pandemic. When our movements are minimized,		 
            many online services can help us live normally and employment-related information can		 
            assist us with our monetary necessities. While we are held back from doing our usual		 
            habits, web access becomes a more significant instrument for securing our health during		 
            a public  health emergency. With this website, students will be more educated regarding		 
            employment opportunities and be able to reap its benefits.</p>
